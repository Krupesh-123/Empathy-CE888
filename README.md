# Empathy-CE888

The EyeT4 dataset contains eye tracking data from 60 participants. The project's primary objective is to analyze this dataset along with the questionnaire data to predict scores. This information can be valuable for recruitment teams looking to identify individuals with levels of empathy for roles such, as nursing.

The Repository Consists of one python notebook file Empathy Reassessment.ipynb. Where we perform EDA and run LassoCV, Random Forest and Linear Regression models on the Test and the Control group participants to determine whether we can predict empathy scores using the eye tracking data. It also compares the prediction ability between Test and the Control group participants. 

You can run the code by downloading the datasets from below sources.
